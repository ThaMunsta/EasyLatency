#EasyLatency

Batch latency tool can ping multiple websites at once.

Edit hosts.txt and add websites you want to ping, one line per website.

host.txt usage: [WEB URL OR IP TO PING]|[PORT TO PING](defaults to 80)|[TEXT BEFORE PING]|[TEXT AFTER PING]

Colours are used to easily see low, medium and high latency.
